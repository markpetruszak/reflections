When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with others or collaborate with others on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The project may not be at a point to share with the public. As well, you may want to wait until a logical block is completed.

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Branches happen only on a local machine and are used when experimenting or adding new features.
 Clone takes place between GitHub and a local machine and makes a complete copy of a project.  It can
 also take place on a local machine in case you may want to make another copy of the project.
 A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
 Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
