How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is temporary storage and gives one time to logically group commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use "git diff", "git diff --staged" and "git diff commit1 commit2" to see what files will be affected by the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
