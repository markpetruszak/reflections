What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git initializes a repository and awaits new commits. It is necessary for git to know what directory(ies) to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is temporary storage and gives one time to logically group commits.
