How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was much easier to see where changes to a file had been introduced.  This would be very
handy with large files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will help to eliminate common mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The commit is a more appropriate size, one logical unit.  If a programmer waits too long more than likely it will involve more than one logical unit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git was developed with programmers in mind. It includes features that developers wanted whereas Docs is more useful for non-programmed documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show all of the commits, starting with the most recent.  Use the down arrow to scroll down the list.
git diff will show all of the lines the were changed between two commits. Again use the down arrow to scroll the list.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because we can always revert back to a prior commit to eliminate the buggy code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My Android projects in Android Studio and my electronics projects using Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
